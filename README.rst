 info.vim  -- Read and navigate Info files in Vim
##################################################

info.vim provides  two features:  syntax highlighting  for Info files generated
from Texinfo,  and it implements a  reader for browsing and  navigating through
info files installed on the user's system.

Info  is the  file  format  of the  `info`  command-line  program  and  Emacs's
info-mode.  This format is most  often generated from Texinfo  source files and
used for software documentation.  Texinfo is the official  documentation format
of GNU.

.. note::

   At the moment info.vim is still *very* early work in progress. Browsing info
   files is not actually implemented. You can test the syntax highlighting of
   manually opened info files at the moment.
