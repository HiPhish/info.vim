There are a number of ways you can help with this project:

Report bugs
   You know the drill: what is the problem, how do you reproduce it? Please
   provide a minimum (non-)working example to tell me what Info document you are
   having trouble and what line.

Submit merge requests
   Read the `HACKING` file first to understand the code, then submit your
   improvements. Unless it's a pure fix you should open an issue to discuss
   your idea so you don't end up wasting your time for nothing.

Please note that the main repository is on GitLab, not GitHub, so only send
merge requests there. Issues on GitHub are OK if you don't want to sign up
there, but I would prefer GitLab for that as well just to have everything in
one place.
