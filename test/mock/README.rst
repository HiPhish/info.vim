 Mock Info files
#################

These text files are  what the output of Info would look  like. They are served
by the mock Info script for testing. The naming scheme is `<file>.<node>.info`.
The name is important so the mock Info can locate the files.

When writing mock  files only add as  much information as necessary,  but if an
existing file would be suitable for  your additions prefer that over creating a
new file.
